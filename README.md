## Summary

- For **cross-browser web testing including Safari** and **real mobile device tests**, Playwright is better suited for ParlayPlayâ€™s diverse user base.  
- For fast setup with **great debugging and component testing**, Cypress remains a strong choice.  
- Maintaining **both frameworks in parallel** allows leveraging their unique strengths and minimizing test blind spots.
